      <td><p> Long ago, back in maybe 2004, I decided I would try my luck searching for a job as an artist for videogames, so I begun practicing pixel art. These characters are examples from that period.</p></td>

    <td><p align=center> I did these characters to try to materialize an old idea for a game called Hacktone, some hacker guy who would hack old hardware using music.<i>The main character would be an hacker rocking a jumpsuit and a samurai sword (so 90's).</i>

    <td><p align=center> A simple gnome with a pipe. Anyone remember a cartoon called <i>David the Gnome</i>? At least here (europe) I used to watch as it a kid...So yeah, not entirely based on that but somewhat inspired by it.
